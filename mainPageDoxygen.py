\section cat Categorization Problem
Text categorization (TC) problem is to classify documents into a predefined number of categories. There are various application areas of TC such as document filtering, automatic meta-data generation, word sense disambiguation, and any document organization related applications.
(Fabrizio Sebastiani. Machine learning in automated text categorization. ACM Comput. Surv.,34(1):1â€“47, 2002.)


\section sol Our solution
In order to solve the problem we have decided to use Recommendation systems (RS). They are software tools which are able to give personalized hints about objects and articles, based on the users' behavior. There are several types of RS. In our project we are going to take the methodology of a Recommendation System that performs content-based filtering, and use it to categorize documents. Our implementation is going to categorize Wikipedia pages according to the TF- IDF values of the words each page contains (TF-IDF will be explained in Section 2.4).
